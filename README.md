# TLock

TLock is an open-source tool to store and manage your authentication tokens securely. It gives users a centralized solution to generate and maintain time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) and other token types for secure authentication processes. By consolidating multiple authentication tokens into a single application, this 2FA manager streamlines the process of accessing accounts while ensuring high security.

## ⭐ Features

- 🚀 Cross-platform - Works perfectly on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- ⚡️ Blazingly Fast app written in Golang.
- 👥 Supports multiple users, each protected optionally with a password.
- ⌨️ Traverse through the UI with customizable key keybindings (can have different keybindings per user).
- 📁 Supports organizing tokens inside of folders.
- 🌟 Supports industry-standard TOTP and HOTP-based tokens.
- 📷 Easily add tokens from the screen or the advanced token editor.
- 🎨 Supports multiple themes to sync the TLock theme with your favorite color scheme.
