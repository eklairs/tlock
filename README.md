# TLock

TLock is an open-source tool to store and manage your authentication tokens securely. It gives users a centralized solution to generate and maintain time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) and other token types for secure authentication processes. By consolidating multiple authentication tokens into a single application, this 2FA manager streamlines the process of accessing accounts while ensuring high security.
